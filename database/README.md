# Database (placeholder)

This folder will contain DB schema, migrations, and seeds. Initial schema will include:

- users (email, wallet, role, created_at)
- waitlist_entries (email, wallet, source, status, created_at)

Suggested DB: Postgres for relational guarantees; consider Prisma or Knex for schema/migrations.
